# tailscale-watchdog.ps1
#
# RemoteWS is a remote-access box - Tailscale is the transport underneath
# almost everything else here (SSH, the fleet checker, JumpConnect's own
# reachability, this watchdog's own sibling watchdogs).
#
# Confirmed 2026-08-28: after a period of WAN flakiness, the Tailscale
# service can end up "Running" but internally wedged - `tailscale status`
# keeps reporting "hasn't received a network map from the coordination
# server in 2m9s" with that duration FROZEN across repeated checks minutes
# apart (i.e. not actually counting up / not actively retrying). Fixed
# manually with `Restart-Service Tailscale -Force`, confirmed by an actual
# successful `tailscale ping` (not just the absence of a warning).
#
# 2026-08-29 (v1 of this watchdog, same day it was deployed): the automated
# restart fired correctly on schedule, but landed Tailscale in a WORSE state
# - BackendState "NoState", "You are logged out. The last login error was:
# fetch control key: ... context canceled/deadline exceeded", unable to
# reach the control plane at all. It took several more minutes (WAN
# genuinely recovering, plus a manual `tailscale up` attempt) before it
# came back on its own. Root cause: the watchdog restarted the service
# without checking whether the control plane was actually reachable at that
# moment - if it wasn't, forcing a re-auth handshake right then just traded
# "wedged but still logged in" for "logged out and can't log back in
# either." This version hardens against exactly that:
#
#   1. Before restarting for the "wedged" case (Running + non-empty Health),
#      first checks TCP reachability to controlplane.tailscale.com:443.
#      If unreachable, defers the restart and just keeps waiting - restarting
#      into a known-unreachable control plane is what caused the regression.
#   2. Separately detects and handles the "logged out" case (BackendState
#      != "Running") - Restart-Service isn't the right tool here, since the
#      Windows service itself is up; what's broken is Tailscale's internal
#      IPN/auth state. Once the control plane is reachable, this runs
#      `tailscale up` (bounded to a timeout via Start-Process/WaitForExit,
#      since `tailscale up` was observed to hang past 120s when the control
#      plane connection was still unstable - an unbounded call here would
#      block this watchdog's entire loop, silently reopening the exact
#      "isn't actually checking anymore" failure mode the 2026-08-29
#      Task-Scheduler-trigger rewrite (see below) already fixed once).
#
# A single unhealthy reading (either kind) is NOT enough to act on - real
# transient blips recovering on their own are normal, and acting on every
# one would fight that AND (per the incident above) risks making things
# worse. Each failure mode gets its own grace period before any action.
#
# 2026-08-29 (same day, earlier): rewritten from a one-shot script fired by
# a Task Scheduler "Daily, repeat every 5 min, for a duration of
# Indefinitely" trigger to a single long-running process with its own
# internal loop, triggered "At system startup" - Power Heartbeat Logger's
# pattern. The repeating-trigger version was actually configured as a plain
# "At startup" trigger (matching Power Heartbeat Logger) with no
# repetition at all, and the script was one-shot - so it correctly ran once
# per boot/manual-trigger and then had nothing telling it to run again. Not
# a Task Scheduler bug, just a trigger/script mismatch: "At startup" needs
# a script that loops forever on its own. The grace-period timers are plain
# in-memory variables now (not marker files) since the process is
# continuous - they reset on a script/service restart, same tradeoff
# power-heartbeat.ps1's reconnect counters accept.
#
# Deployed via Scheduled Task "Tailscale Watchdog" (At system startup, runs
# as SYSTEM - Restart-Service on another session's service needs admin
# rights, and SYSTEM doesn't need an interactive RDP logon to start).
#
# Logs into the SAME shared watchdog_remotews.log that FleetMetricsWatchdog.
# ps1 (and JumpConnect Watchdog) already write to, not a separate file - the
# fleet dashboard's existing "WATCHDOG" button/badges already fetch and
# parse that exact file via fleet_api.py's /api/watchdog/<host> endpoint
# (see Status/Web/ST/tiles.html), and "remotews" is already in its host
# list. Piggybacking on it means this shows up on the dashboard with no
# server or dashboard changes - just prefix every line with "[Tailscale]"
# so it stays distinguishable from the other watchdogs' lines. The
# dashboard's parser treats any line containing "fail" (case-insensitive)
# as an issue and anything else recent as reassuring activity - the prefix
# doesn't interfere with either check, both are substring matches.
#
# ASCII only - PowerShell 5.1 has no BOM handling and mis-decodes non-ASCII.
