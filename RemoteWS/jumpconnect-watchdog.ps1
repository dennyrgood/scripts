# jumpconnect-watchdog.ps1
#
# RemoteWS is a remote-access box - Jump Desktop (via the JumpConnect service,
# Phase Five Systems) is the primary remote-desktop path, SSH is the fallback.
#
# Confirmed 2026-08-22: after a WiFi/network outage, JumpConnect can come back
# "Running" but wedged - its outbound connection to Jump's relay went stale
# during the blip and it never reconnects on its own. Windows' own service
# recovery config (3x auto-restart on failure) does NOT help here, because the
# process never actually crashes/exits - it just sits there alive and useless.
# SSH (a fresh TCP connection each time) kept working the whole time, which is
# how this got noticed; fixed manually with `Restart-Service JumpConnect`.
#
# This watchdog automates that manual fix: JumpConnect "Running" is not enough
# to call it healthy - also require at least one ESTABLISHED outbound TCP
# connection on its process (confirmed healthy pattern: PID holds a :443
# connection to Jump's relay). No such connection => treat as wedged and force
# a service restart, the same fix that worked by hand.
#
# 2026-08-29: rewritten from a one-shot script fired by a Task Scheduler
# "Daily, repeat every 5 min, for a duration of Indefinitely" trigger to a
# single long-running process with its own internal loop, triggered "At
# system startup" - exactly Power Heartbeat Logger's pattern. The repeating-
# trigger version silently stopped being re-invoked after about 3 days with
# no error (LastTaskResult 0, NextRunTime just went blank) - a known Windows
# Task Scheduler quirk where "repeat indefinitely" doesn't actually mean
# indefinitely. Power Heartbeat Logger never had this problem because it was
# never relying on that repetition mechanism in the first place. This changes
# to match: no Task Scheduler repetition setting to silently expire, just one
# process that loops forever until the box reboots (at which point "At
# startup" + SYSTEM brings it right back, no logon required - see Power
# Heartbeat Logger's own notes on why that matters here).
#
# Deployed via Scheduled Task "JumpConnect Watchdog" (At system startup, runs
# as SYSTEM - Restart-Service on another session's service needs admin
# rights, and SYSTEM doesn't need an interactive RDP logon to start).
#
# 2026-08-28: logs into the SAME shared watchdog_remotews.log that
# FleetMetricsWatchdog.ps1 already writes to (not a separate file) - the
# fleet dashboard's existing "WATCHDOG" button/badges already fetch and
# parse that exact file via fleet_api.py's /api/watchdog/<host> endpoint
# (see Status/Web/ST/tiles.html), and "remotews" is already in its host
# list. Piggybacking on it means this shows up on the dashboard with no
# server or dashboard changes - just prefix every line with "[JumpConnect]"
# so it stays distinguishable from FleetMetricsWatchdog's own lines. The
# dashboard's parser treats any line containing "fail" (case-insensitive)
# as an issue and anything else recent as reassuring activity - the prefix
# doesn't interfere with either check, both are substring matches.
#
# ASCII only - PowerShell 5.1 has no BOM handling and mis-decodes non-ASCII.
