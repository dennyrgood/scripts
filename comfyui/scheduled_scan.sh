# obvious file to open) and automatic pruning of old timestamped output
# (so fleet-output/ doesn't grow forever, the way it did across one day's

# $OUTPUT_DIR lives inside OneDrive's live-syncing tree, and a long-running
# `python3 -m http.server` process holding that as its launchd WorkingDirectory
# was found (twice in <24h) to get its cached cwd handle invalidated by an
# OneDrive sync operation -- `ls` on the directory worked fine the whole time,
# but the server's own directory listing returned "No permission to list
# directory" for hours until manually restarted. Rather than keep auto-healing
# around that (see mb-health-monitor.sh's matching 2026-08-31 comment, which
# stays in place as a safety net), the server now points at a plain local
# directory that OneDrive never touches, refreshed from $OUTPUT_DIR at the end
# of every scan below -- same-day fresh, but immune to OneDrive's sync churn.

# Never again -- announce the line number and exit code on any unexpected death.

# Keep the last 3 runs' worth of timestamped files (inputs, fleet-output,
# history). Runs BEFORE the latest/mirror step below so the published copies
# and the mirror reflect the same retention window -- prune always keeps the
# newest run, so the report just generated is never the one pruned.
# Pinned to the Homebrew interpreter: under launchd's minimal PATH a bare
# `python3` resolves to Apple's 3.9.6, which predates the PEP 604 `str | None`
# hints this file uses (and, per the TCC note below, lacks the Full Disk Access
# the Homebrew build has).

# it never goes stale, using the fresh CSVs comfy_fleet.sh just produced.
# Writes only into $OUTPUT_DIR/ (report) and $OUTPUT_DIR/thumbs/ (PNG
# thumbnails via `sips`) -- both already proven python3-writable under
# launchd; `sips`'s own TCC access under launchd is unconfirmed as of this
# writing, so a thumbnail failure must not be treated as a fatal error here

# --- Post-scan housekeeping: ALL of it in python3, deliberately -----------------
# Under launchd this agent has NO shell-level access to the OneDrive
# CloudStorage folder. Probed directly 2026-09-04 from a launchd-launched
# process:
#     ls  : DENIED      cp : DENIED      cmp : DENIED
#     /opt/homebrew/bin/python3 : OK (23 entries)
# That is macOS TCC granting Full Disk Access per-binary; python3 has it,
# the system shell utilities do not. It works interactively because a Terminal
# shell inherits Terminal's own grant.
#
# This is why three separate bugs hid here for weeks, each masking the next:
#   1. `ls -t ... | head -1` under `set -euo pipefail` -> SIGPIPE killed the run
#      before anything else could be reached.
#   2. the bare glob matched fleet_report_latest.html itself -> `cp X X` failed.
#   3. and underneath both: ls/cp/cmp/rsync were being DENIED the whole time,
#      so even "fixed" the copies silently did nothing -- `|| true` turned the
#      failure into an empty variable and the guarded `cp` just never ran,
#      leaving fleet_report_latest.html and the served mirror permanently stale.
# Doing the work in the one binary that actually has access removes the class
# of problem rather than patching each symptom.
