# Created: 2026-08-30 UTC — denniss-macbook-air (mb) service health monitor, modeled on
# MathesMacMini/mathes-mac-mini-health-monitor.sh but scoped to what actually runs on
# THIS box: the local web services in `launchmgr status`. Does NOT port mmm's
# Plex/Syncthing/NUT-UPS checks — none of those run here. `comfy-fleet-scan` is
# deliberately excluded too: it's a once-daily StartCalendarInterval job, not a
# KeepAlive service, so "process missing" is its normal state 23:55 hours a day —
# its freshness is checked in mb-nightly-summary.sh instead, the same way mmm's
# nightly script (not its health monitor) owns the Plex-sync-log freshness check.
#
# Services covered here (all launchd KeepAlive, per `launchmgr status` 2026-08-30):
#   comfy-fleet-http    (5050, static file server for fleet_report_*.html)
#   fleet-metrics-server (9100, serves this box's own heartbeat/metrics files)
#   heartbeat-writer    (writes those files — no HTTP endpoint of its own)
#   search-adv-web      (5025)
#   search-shows-web    (5020)
#   tmdb-explorer       (5035, this box's own instance — mmm runs an independent copy)
#   travel-http         (5030, static file server for the travel site)
#
# Run via launchd every 5 min (see com.dennis.mb-health-monitor.plist). Alerts on
# first detection and every 30 min while a condition persists; sends all-clear when
# it resolves; silent when everything's healthy. Missing vs down distinction per
# service (mirrors mmm/WBU): missing = process not found (crashed/quit), down =
# process running but its own HTTP endpoint isn't answering (hung).

# incident this same day showed a transient OneDrive sync lock on that folder can
# wedge the process's directory listing (curl 404 "No permission to list
# directory") for 10+ minutes without self-healing (needed a manual kickstart),
# so the flakiness is real, not a false positive -- but it's also a low-stakes
# personal convenience server, not fleet-critical infra like heartbeat-writer/

# known-flaky service without dulling real alerts for the services that actually
# blind the fleet dashboard if missed.

FOOTER="------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT THESE ALERTS MEAN AND WHAT TO DO
------------------------------------------------------------------------

<SVC> MISSING:
No process matching the service's launchd command was found — it quit or
crashed. Requires ${FAIL_THRESHOLD} consecutive checks (~$((FAIL_THRESHOLD * 5)) min) before
alerting for most services (COMFY_HTTP uses a longer ${FAIL_THRESHOLD_COMFY_HTTP}-check
/ ~$((FAIL_THRESHOLD_COMFY_HTTP * 5))-min threshold — it's prone to transient
OneDrive-sync hiccups on the folder it serves), to ride out a normal restart.
All of these are launchd KeepAlive agents, so this firing at all usually means
it's crash-looping faster than launchd can win.

What to do:
  1. launchctl list | grep com.dennis
  2. launchctl kickstart -k gui/\$(id -u)/com.dennis.<label>
  3. Check that service's own log under ~/Library/Logs/ for why it exited.

<SVC> NOT RESPONDING:
The process is running but its own HTTP endpoint isn't answering — likely hung.

What to do:
  1. curl the service's URL (see the *_URL constants at the top of this script)
  2. If hung: launchctl kickstart -k gui/\$(id -u)/com.dennis.<label>

HEARTBEAT_WRITER MISSING:
No process matching '${HEARTBEAT_WRITER_PROC_PATTERN}' found — this box's own
fleet-status heartbeat/machine_info/metrics_history files have stopped
updating, which silently blinds the fleet dashboard to this box even though
everything else here may be fine.

What to do:
  1. launchctl kickstart -k gui/\$(id -u)/com.dennis.heartbeat-writer
  2. cat ~/Library/Logs/heartbeat_writer.log — look for why it exited

HEARTBEAT_WRITER NOT RESPONDING:
The process is running but ${HEARTBEAT_FILE} hasn't been updated within
${HEARTBEAT_STALE_SECS}s (it should tick every 150s) — likely hung mid-loop.

What to do:
  1. ls -la ${HEARTBEAT_FILE}   -- confirm how stale
  2. launchctl kickstart -k gui/\$(id -u)/com.dennis.heartbeat-writer

METRICS_SERVER MISSING / NOT RESPONDING:
No process matching '${METRICS_SERVER_PROC_PATTERN}', or it's running but not
serving this box's own heartbeat file over HTTP (127.0.0.1:9100). The fleet
checker pulls from here over Tailscale — either failure mode means the fleet
dashboard can't see this box, even if HEARTBEAT_WRITER itself is fine.

What to do:
  1. curl http://127.0.0.1:9100/heartbeat_${HOST}.txt
  2. launchctl kickstart -k gui/\$(id -u)/com.dennis.fleet-metrics-server
