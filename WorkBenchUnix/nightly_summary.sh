# Daily health summary email — tails all backup logs, checks health monitor
# freshness and active alerts, sends via msmtp.
# 2026-07-03 09:00 UTC — added TLDR block
# 2026-07-03 09:30 UTC — switched grep -v to -vE for alternation
# 2026-07-03 11:00 UTC — replaced fragile word-scan STATUS check with per-log success-string check
# 2026-07-05 HH:MM UTC — added 6-hour staleness check for CWHU sync log
# 2026-07-12 UTC — renamed subject "Backup Summary" -> "Health Summary".
#                  Added wbu-health-monitor watchdog: freshness (>15 min = NOT OK),
#                  active alerts by name in TLDR, state file dumped at bottom.
#                  Corrected header path from /srv/immich/scripts/ to actual cron location.
# 2026-07-23 UTC — added system-health section after an unrecoverable rcu_preempt
#                  stall + hard reset: (1) NVMe SMART one-liner, (2) unclean-reboot
#                  post-mortem (auto-dumps the prior boot's rcu/oom/lockup/error
#                  lines, keyed by explicit boot ID to dodge post-crash clock skew),
#                  (3) kernel crash-capture (/sys/fs/pstore) dump. Each contributes
#                  a TLDR line and can flip STATUS to NOT OK. Pairs with the
#                  kernel.panic_on_rcu_stall sysctl (99-wbu-crash-capture.conf).
# 2026-08-03 UTC — added the two daily FleetNAS Immich backups (db 05:00, images
#                  05:20, both well finished by the 06:30 send). Unlike the
#                  Friday-only Mac Mini logs these are daily, so they get the
#                  full treatment: tail + TLDR line, success-string check, and a
#                  24h staleness check that catches a missed night on the very
#                  next email.
# 2026-08-03 UTC — every TLDR log line now carries a relative age "[3d ago]". The
#                  subject gate reports only the single highest-priority failure,
#                  so a stale log was invisible whenever another check won the
#                  gate — which is exactly what happened on the first FleetNAS
#                  email: a 3-day-old db log displayed its cheerful "complete"
#                  last line while the images check owned the subject.
# 2026-09-13 UTC — added the Immich assets & trash block (TLDR line, daily counts TSV,
#                  two subject alerts) after an intentional cleanup expired out of
#                  Immich's trash with no warning. Tidied the body: manual-only export
#                  logs listed only when present, CWHU sync_errors only when it holds
#                  more than docker compose progress, monitor state only non-zero
#                  entries, UPS cut to the fields that change. NO_MAIL=1 prints the
#                  message instead of sending it, for testing.
