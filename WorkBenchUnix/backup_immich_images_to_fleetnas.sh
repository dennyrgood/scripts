# Created: 2026-07-31 UTC — pushes the live Immich image library from WBU to FleetNAS
# (UGREEN DXP6800 Pro, RAID 5 / Btrfs), then verifies. Runs ON WorkBenchUnix. One-way
# push, daily. FleetNAS is becoming the backup-of-record now that backup-a/b/c are all
# disabled (backup-c: USB-bridge/rcu-stall corruption, not media failure).
#
# Shape borrowed from backup_immich_images_to_macmini.sh (push from WBU to a dumb file
# store), NOT from CWHU's restore_from_wbu.sh. CWHU's script is a *restore*: it tears
# down a live Immich stack, wipes Postgres and replays the dump, because CWHU runs a
# warm standby it has to reconstitute. FleetNAS runs no Immich, so none of that applies.
# A pull would also have to run ON the NAS, where UGOS's overlay filesystem and
# non-user-managed cron make it far harder to maintain than a cron line here.
#
# Two things ARE borrowed from restore_from_wbu.sh, both hard-won:
#   1. Preflight health check (iowait + D-state, same signal/thresholds as
#      wbu-health-monitor.sh). On 2026-07-23 WBU's own I/O distress (RCU stalls)
#      corrupted data mid-transfer. Since this push runs --delete against the
#      backup-of-record, a distressed WBU must not get to touch it — skip the night.
#   2. ConnectTimeout/ServerAlive on every ssh/rsync, so a wedged connection fails in
#      ~25s instead of hanging until someone notices.
#
# Two deliberate improvements over the Mac Mini script:
#   1. --max-delete guard. rsync --delete faithfully propagates mass deletion, whether
#      it came from the user or from a corrupted source tree. Above the threshold the
#      run aborts rather than replaying the damage onto the backup.
#   2. Verification is a second `rsync -ain --delete` dry run instead of the Mac Mini
#      script's per-file ssh loop. That loop matched on *basename anywhere in the
#      destination tree* (so a file in the wrong directory counted as present) and cost
#      one SSH round-trip per flagged file. The dry run is path-exact, notices content
#      drift rather than mere presence, and uses a single connection.
#
# Deletions are still recoverable: FleetNAS takes scheduled Btrfs snapshots of
# /volume1/immich, which this key cannot reach. That, not the push direction, is what
# protects the backup from the source.

# TWO different ways to name the same directory on FleetNAS — do not merge them.
#
# DEST_RSYNC: UGOS ships a patched rsync whose server side rejects absolute paths
# outright ("invalid path: '/volume1/immich/images/'", and a UGREEN-added "not
# support path" string in the binary). It addresses destinations by SHARE NAME with
# no /volume1 prefix — so "immich/images/", not "/volume1/immich/images/". The share
# names only resolve once Control Panel -> File Services -> "Enable backup rsync
# service" is on with an authorized account; before that, every path is rejected and
# it looks like the share-name form is broken too. Ref:
# https://www.kevinhooke.com/2025/10/19/rsync-files-to-a-ugreen-nas/
#
# DEST_PATH: plain ssh commands (mkdir/ls/find below) are NOT affected by the patch
# and need the real absolute path.
#
# Worth knowing why it's this way and not the two obvious alternatives: rsync's
# daemon-over-ssh form (host::module) is broken in UGREEN's build — it never sends a
# server greeting — and the plain daemon on port 873 requires a password, which would
# mean storing a NAS credential in a file on WBU and sending 111GB unencrypted. The
# share-name-over-ssh form avoids both: existing key auth, no new secret, encrypted.
