# Fleet — Off-Site Backup (Immich → restic → s3g)

Created: 2026-08-25 UTC
Companion to: Fleet — Next-Level Plan (Q3/Q4 2026), Workstream A1
Status: **built and running.** Initial seed to s3g in progress.

---

## Purpose

Supersedes Workstream A1 of the Next-Level Plan (Google Drive + rclone + restic).
That plan assumed Google Drive had "hundreds of GB free"; the real figures killed it:

- Google Drive: 47.12 GB used of 200 GB → ~153 GB free. Too tight for a growing library.
- OneDrive: ~800 GB free, but ruled out — its client handles ~100,000 small files
  (the raw image tree) poorly: throttling, slow reconciliation, and no way to tell
  "done" from "still churning".

**Decision:** no cloud. restic for versioned, integrity-checked backups on wbu,
replicated off-site to Gran Canaria via Syncthing.

### Why this exists at all

wbu already mirrors to FleetNAS nightly and Mac Mini weekly. Those are
`rsync --delete` **mirrors**: a bad deletion or a corrupted file propagates to
them within 24 h and the previous good state is gone. `--max-delete=500` catches
mass deletion, not the slow kind.

This adds the two things a mirror cannot give:

1. **Point-in-time rollback** — snapshots.
2. **Integrity verification** — proof that what was stored is what was read.

Geographic separation is the third gain, and the reason for the Syncthing leg.

## What is actually backed up

| Path | Size | In backup? |
|---|---|---|
| `images/upload` | 85 GiB | **yes** — the originals, irreplaceable |
| `images/profile` | 124 KiB | **yes** |
| `images/library` | 8 KiB | **yes** |
| `postgres-dumps-latest/` | 4.2 GiB | **yes** — `pg_dumpall` of the whole cluster |
| `images/thumbs` | 20 GiB | no — Immich regenerates |
| `images/encoded-video` | 1.9 GiB | no — Immich regenerates |
| `images/backups` | 8.4 GiB | no — Immich's own DB dump, redundant with the above |
| `export_flat/` | 83 GiB | no — derived by `export_archive.py` |
| `export_multi/` | 116 GiB | no — derived by `export_archive.py` |

**Backup set: ~89 GiB.** (The original doc said ~118 GB; that predated the
exclusions below.)

### Why the exclusions

`thumbs/` and `encoded-video/` are derived data. Including them would add ~22 GiB
to the repo and — the real cost — ~22 GiB to the initial over-the-wire seed and to
every prune-driven re-replication after it. Price on a restore day: Immich
regenerates thumbnails and transcodes for ~280k assets. Hours, unattended, nothing
irreplaceable at stake.

`images/backups/` is Immich's own DB dump. `postgres-dumps-latest/` already holds a
`pg_dumpall` of the entire cluster, which is strictly more complete.

`export_flat/` and `export_multi/` are 199 GiB of reorganised copies of the same
photos, regenerable from the library plus the DB, and already pushed to Mac Mini and
AmsterdamDesktop. They are also the space release valve: deleting them frees 199 GiB
on `/mnt/immich-data`.

To include the derived data anyway, set `BACKUP_DERIVED="yes"` in
`backup_immich_to_restic.sh`.

---

## Where the repo lives

**`/mnt/immich-backup/restic`** — on `nvme0n1p3`, reclaimed from Windows.

| | |
|---|---|
| Device | `/dev/nvme0n1p3`, 248.7 GiB, ext4, label `immich-backup` |
| Usable | 244 GB (`-m 0` — no root reserve on a data volume) |
| Repo ID | `3866241e02`, format version 2, compression `auto` |
| Repo size | 84.25 GiB for 89.2 GiB of source |
| fstab | `UUID=5217f4ed-… /mnt/immich-backup ext4 defaults,nofail,x-systemd.device-timeout=5 0 2` |

`nofail` is deliberate: a problem on the backup volume must never block boot of the
Immich host.

### The repo is a subdirectory, not the mount root

If the repo sat at the mount root and the volume failed to mount,
`/mnt/immich-backup` would fall back to an empty directory on `/` (37 GB free) and
restic would build a second repo there, quietly filling the root filesystem. One
level down, that path simply does not exist when unmounted, so restic fails loudly.
`backup_immich_to_restic.sh` also guards with `mountpoint -q` on both volumes.

### Reclaiming p3 from Windows

The 596 GB `/mnt/immich-data` had 249 GB free, but sharing a partition with the
source was unappealing. `nvme0n1p3` held a live, bootable Windows 11 install using
99 GB of 249 GB. Contents were surveyed and confirmed expendable: Windows itself,
two embedded Python distributions (`OpenWebUI`, `Misc`), CUDA DLLs
(`OllamaBackup`), a GitHub checkout of this repo, 26 GB of `$Recycle.Bin`, and
868 MB of Downloads.

p3 sits immediately *before* p4 on disk, so its space could not be merged into
`/mnt/immich-data` without relocating 317 GB. It was reformatted as its own
filesystem instead — which is also better isolation: filesystem corruption or a
fat-fingered `rm -rf` on `immich-data` no longer takes the repo with it. Same
physical NVMe, so a device failure still kills both; that is what the s3g copy is
for.

**The Win 11 Pro licence was deliberately not salvaged.** It was not an OEM
firmware licence — no `MSDM` or `SLIC` ACPI table — so it did not survive the wipe.

### Two pieces of boot drift found and fixed on the way

- **The EFI System Partition was never mounted** and had no fstab entry (p1 carries
  the GPT *no-automount* attribute). The boot stack on it was intact, but
  `grub-efi`/`shim` updates had nowhere to write. Now pinned in fstab.
- **`shim-signed` was not installed at all**, despite `shimx64.efi` sitting on the
  ESP from the original install. Now package-managed.

Secure Boot is disabled and the platform is in Setup Mode.

## Schedule

| Time | Job |
|---|---|
| 03:30 | `dump_immich_db_for_cwhu.sh` → `postgres-dumps-latest/` |
| **04:00** | **`backup_immich_to_restic.sh`** — backup, forget, (monthly prune), check |
| 05:00 / 05:20 | FleetNAS DB and image mirrors |
| **06:25** | **`syncthing_offsite_status.sh`** — off-site replication check |
| 06:30 | `nightly_summary.sh` — email |

04:00 sits after the DB dump, so every snapshot contains that morning's fresh
`pg_dumpall`, and finishes well before the FleetNAS sync. Nightly deltas take
seconds — the first full backup took 137 s at ~450 MB/s; an unchanged run takes 12 s.

---

## Retention and pruning

```
restic forget --keep-daily 14 --keep-weekly 8 --keep-monthly 24
```

Two years of rollback, ~46 snapshots. Chosen over the original 7/4/6 draft because
snapshots of a mostly append-only photo library dedupe almost completely — the only
data retained is what was later changed or deleted — so a longer horizon costs
little disk. The threat model is a bad deletion during dedup/face-grouping cleanup
propagating to FleetNAS unnoticed, and that can go unspotted for months.

### Prune runs monthly, not nightly

`PRUNE_DAY="01"`.

`forget` only deletes small snapshot metadata files — invisible to replication.
**`prune` rewrites pack files**, and every repacked pack must cross the link to
Gran Canaria again. Pruning nightly would keep the off-site transfer permanently
churning. With 244 GB of volume for a ~85 GB repo there is no space pressure
forcing the issue.

---

## Integrity checking

```
restic check --read-data-subset=N/30    # N = day-of-year % 30 + 1
```

Structure check every night, plus a rotating thirtieth of the pack data re-hashed,
so the entire repo is byte-verified over 30 days.

**Until 2026-09-16 this was a fixed `1/30`**, and restic's `n/t` form reads the same
group every run -- so wbu re-read the same 164 packs nightly and never looked at the
rest. s3g's passphrase-free hash check found the result: two packs written during the
RAM-fault diagnostic rerun (2026-08-25 17:48:36Z) whose contents do not match their
names, identical on both ends. See the RAM fault section.

A full `restic check --read-data` (1m38s for the whole repo) then found **three
more** packs (`27bc301e…`, `4e2d7a97…`, `6ea64c49…`) whose file hash *matches* their
name but each hold one blob that fails decryption -- the flip happened before
restic hashed the pack. Name-vs-hash checks
(s3g's, or `sha256sum`) cannot see that class of damage; only a decrypting read on
wbu can. 2,844 packs were written during the faulty-RAM runs (17:38-18:09Z).

Repair (2026-09-16): `restic repair packs` on all five, which salvaged every
intact blob and lost one blob per pack; the next backup re-stored all five from the
still-present source JPGs ("not found in the repository index; storing the file
again", rc=3). A second full `--read-data` then found no errors, and no
`repair snapshots --forget` was needed -- every snapshot is whole. Reads only — no Syncthing traffic.

This is what turns "a backup I have never verified" into a checked fact, and it
earned its place before it was ever scheduled (see the RAM fault below).

---

## Transport: Syncthing → s3g

**Correction to the original doc**, which stated Syncthing was "already deployed
across the relevant nodes" and "already running". It was **not installed on wbu at
all**. It was already running on s3g, paired with mmm.

| | |
|---|---|
| wbu | Syncthing 1.30.0, upstream apt repo, runs as `dhm` (not root) |
| s3g | Syncthing 2.1.3 — different major, interoperating fine |
| Folder ID | `immich-restic` |
| wbu path | `/mnt/immich-backup/restic` — **Send Only** |
| s3g path | `D:\Immich` — **Receive Only** |
| Versioning | off on both — restic already versions |
| Ignore permissions | on — the far end is Windows |
| wbu device ID | `VUU2OPZ-YSV3GJW-USASOK4-V5AEZUR-EKHZ22Q-OVPUUF6-54NVRPI-2EJWFQA` |
| s3g device ID | `2U2VAWO-KDK4BX5-2W37CAZ-FA7R7BK-TTM3X4H-74YNQCQ-5JEV6RN-OHE2PQB` |

**Send Only / Receive Only** means nothing at the far end — a stray edit, a
filesystem fault, ransomware — can propagate back into the repo depended on here.

### `.stignore` excludes `/locks`

restic takes a lock for every operation. A replicated stale lock would obstruct a
restore at the far end, precisely when an obstacle is least welcome. Everything else
in the repo is immutable packs, which suits Syncthing well.

### The daemon runs unprivileged

Syncthing runs as `dhm`, not root, because **the repo is encrypted** — an
unprivileged reader gets ciphertext. `keys/` holds the master key wrapped with
scrypt, inert without the passphrase, which lives at `/root/.restic-passphrase`,
root-only, and deliberately **outside** the synced tree. `keys/` and `config` must
replicate or the s3g copy would be undecryptable packs.

The repo was initially created root-only (`init-restic-repo.sh` ran under
`umask 077` to protect the passphrase file, and restic inherited it). Fixed with
`chmod -R a+rX`; `backup_immich_to_restic.sh` now sets `umask 022` explicitly so
cron cannot recreate the problem.

### Gotcha: restic's file modes cannot be relied on

On 2026-08-26, the first unattended cron run created four files -- an index, a
snapshot and two data packs -- as `0440 root:root`. Syncthing runs as `dhm`,
which is not in group `root`, so it could not open them.

**Syncthing then reported the folder 100% complete.** Files it fails to read are
excluded from the completion figure entirely -- they are in neither the numerator
nor the denominator -- so the only place the truth appeared was the folder's
`errors` count. A repo missing an index, a snapshot and two packs is not a stale
backup, it is an unrestorable one.

The cause is not umask: `umask 022` is set explicitly in the backup script, there
are no ACLs on the volume, and every repo directory is 0755. restic simply chose
0440. Rather than reverse-engineer its mode derivation, the script now normalises
after every run and **verifies**:

```
chmod -R a+rX "$REPO"
UNREADABLE=$(find "$REPO" -type f ! -perm -o+r | wc -l)
[ "$UNREADABLE" -eq 0 ] || die "... syncthing cannot replicate them"
```

The `find` is the important half. A bare `chmod` would silently do nothing if
restic ever produced something `a+rX` cannot reach; counting afterwards turns
that into a failed backup and a red subject line instead of another quiet gap.

After a manual fix, Syncthing needs a rescan to notice -- `ignorePerms=true`
means a permission change does not trip the file watcher. `systemctl restart
syncthing@dhm` forces one. The API takes a few seconds to come back up after
that restart, so an immediately following status check will report the API as
unreachable; wait and re-run.

### Connectivity

Discovery found nothing for s3g — the address was empty and nothing connected until
it was pinned. Device address is set to `dynamic, tcp://100.72.84.84:22000`: still
attempts discovery and hole-punching, but always has a known-good Tailscale fallback
so a dropped connection cannot leave it silently disconnected for days.

Tailscale upgraded from DERP(mad) to a **direct** path once traffic started, so the
seed runs peer-to-peer. ufw allows 22000/tcp and 22000/udp; without that, Syncthing
falls back to its own shared relay.

GUI is on `0.0.0.0:8384` with TLS and a password, restricted by ufw to the tailnet
(`100.64.0.0/10`) and LAN (`192.168.178.0/24`).

---

## Monitoring

Both layers report into the nightly summary email with purpose-built TLDR lines.

```
  restic backup:  [2h ago] snapshots retained: 2   repo size on disk: 85G ✓
  off-site (s3g): ⏳ [5m ago] 5.67%, 79.49GiB outstanding, ETA ~5.5h — no complete copy yet
```

### The restic marker means the backup is good, not that the script finished

`RESTIC BACKUP VERIFIED OK` is emitted only after backup **and** forget **and** the
integrity check all succeed. A corrupted blob or a failed `check` can never read as
success. This follows the convention already established for `$FLEETNAS_IMG` in
`nightly_summary.sh`.

### The backup run confirms the copy reached Gran Canaria

A verified local repo is only half the claim, so `backup_immich_to_restic.sh`
waits for the packs it just wrote to actually land at s3g before reporting
success. Nothing runs on s3g for this: Syncthing computes completion from what
the REMOTE reports holding, and the remote builds that by hashing what it
wrote, so "0 outstanding, 0 errors" is a statement about s3g's disk rather than
about what wbu transmitted.

Three details make it honest rather than decorative:

**It forces a rescan first.** The folder has `fsWatcherDelayS=10`, so seconds
after restic writes a new snapshot and index, Syncthing has not noticed them --
and `needBytes` would read 0 because the files are *unknown*, not because they
were delivered. The first version of this check passed in 0 s for exactly that
reason. It now POSTs to `/rest/db/scan` before polling.

**It requires `state=idle` on two consecutive polls.** A single reading taken
between the rescan finishing and the transfer starting is indistinguishable
from genuinely being up to date.

**The wait is progress-aware, not a flat timeout.** A fixed value cannot suit
both cases: the nightly delta settles in seconds, while importing a few
thousand photos legitimately takes half an hour on a 2.4 MiB/s link. It keeps
waiting while the outstanding byte count is falling, and gives up once it stops
moving for two minutes -- at which point more waiting achieves nothing.
`OFFSITE_WAIT_SECS=7200` is only a backstop against pathological slowness.

Outcomes, in the run's final line:

| Result | Backup verdict |
|---|---|
| `confirmed at s3g (100%, 0 errors, 30s)` | success |
| `still syncing (94.1%, 4.20GiB outstanding)` | **success** — the local backup is good, and a deliberate import should not turn the subject red |
| `STALLED (61.0%, 12.4GiB outstanding)` | success, but flagged; the 06:25 check judges it against the backlog limit |
| folder reports N errors | **FAILURE** |

Errors fail the run because that is the 2026-08-26 bug: unreadable files were
silently excluded from the completion figure while the copy sat unrestorable.
Outstanding bytes do not fail it, because failing on a large import you did on
purpose is how alerts get ignored.

### The off-site line has three states, not two

| Glyph | Meaning | Subject line |
|---|---|---|
| `✓` | a complete off-site copy exists and is current | unaffected |
| `⏳` | healthy, but not there yet — seeding or catching up | **unaffected** |
| `⚠️` | broken — needs action | goes red, with the reason |

A tick would overstate the protection in place: at 5% seeded there is no off-site
backup at all. A warning would cry wolf nightly during a legitimate seed and hijack
the subject. The hourglass says "not there yet, and that is known".

It further distinguishes **initial seed** (no complete copy has ever existed — the
current state) from **catching up** (a copy exists and is briefly behind, shown as
`last complete Nh ago`). Same percentage, very different exposure.

### What turns the subject red, and how fast

| Failure | Detected |
|---|---|
| s3g unreachable > 24 h (`LAST_SEEN_MAX_H`) | next morning |
| folder reports errors | next morning |
| zero progress since the previous check | next morning |
| backlog persists > 3 days (`BACKLOG_MAX_DAYS`) | at 3 days |

The last one is the backstop against a transfer that creeps along forever without
ever technically stalling. 3 days against an 8-hour seed ETA is ~9× margin. Raise it
only if a genuine large import repeatedly trips it.

Backlog age is measured from a recorded start timestamp in
`/var/lib/syncthing-offsite.state`, not by counting runs, so running the script by
hand does not distort it.

---

## Integrity: what checks what

The 2026-08-26 and 2026-08-28 findings had the same shape twice: a metric read
healthy because the thing it measured had not actually been looked at. Every
check below therefore compares CONTENT against a record that does not assume
WBU is correct. None of them look at size or mtime, which is what let a
corrupted file sit on FleetNAS from June until it was found.

| Check | Compares | Cadence | Automated |
|---|---|---|---|
| restic blob hash on write | data in RAM vs its hash | every backup | yes |
| restic `check --read-data-subset=1/30` | repo packs vs their ids | nightly, full repo monthly | yes |
| off-site confirmation | s3g's report vs what was just written | after every backup | yes |
| `syncthing_offsite_status.sh` | connection, errors, backlog age | 06:25 daily | yes |
| `verify_immich_source_integrity.sh` | originals vs Immich's ingest SHA-1 | Sun 02:00 | yes |
| `audit_mirror_checksums.sh fleetnas` | FleetNAS bytes vs WBU bytes | 15th 02:00 | yes |
| `audit_mirror_checksums.sh macmini` | Mac Mini bytes vs WBU bytes | 15th 02:40 | yes |
| `verify-restic-integrity-scheduled.ps1` | s3g's packs vs their ids | 16th 03:00, on s3g | yes |
| `verify-offsite-restic.ps1` | s3g repo opens and returns files | occasional, by hand | no |

### Which scripts need sudo, and which must not have it

Two groups, split by what they write rather than by what they do. Getting it
wrong fails in confusing ways, so it is worth stating plainly.

| Script | Run as | Because |
|---|---|---|
| `backup_immich_to_restic.sh` | **root** (`sudo`) | reads the passphrase file, writes `/var/log` |
| `syncthing_offsite_status.sh` | **root** (`sudo`) | writes `/var/log` and `/var/lib` |
| `nightly_summary.sh` | **root** (`sudo`) | reads `/var/log`, NVMe SMART, pstore |
| `verify_immich_source_integrity.sh` | **dhm** (no sudo) | only needs docker group + readable source |
| `audit_mirror_checksums.sh` | **dhm** (no sudo) | only needs dhm's ssh keys + readable source |
| `restic-wbu` | **root** (`sudo`) | the passphrase file is root-only |

The dhm ones sit in dhm's crontab beside `backup_immich_images_to_macmini.sh`
and `_to_fleetnas.sh`, which need exactly the same access. The root ones sit in
root's crontab beside `dump_immich_db_for_cwhu.sh`.

Running a dhm script under sudo leaves root-owned logs in `~/.cache`, which then
refuses the next non-sudo run. Running a root script as dhm sprays
`tee: Permission denied` on every line while still printing a success marker --
it looks like it worked and records nothing. Both scripts now check and say
which way round they want to be run.

### The one that closes the circle

`verify_immich_source_integrity.sh` is the only check that can catch WBU itself
being wrong. Every other one compares a copy against WBU's current file, so if
an original rots on this disk, restic stores the rotten version, verifies it
perfectly, replicates it to Gran Canaria, and everything reports green. Immich
records a SHA-1 for all 70,458 assets at ingest, and that is the only
independent record of the original bytes.

### The far end checks itself without a key

Syncthing verifies block hashes on TRANSFER and re-hashes only files whose size
or mtime changed -- it never re-reads unchanged files, so rot on s3g's disk
would leave completion reading 100% forever.

`verify-restic-integrity-scheduled.ps1` closes that, and needs no passphrase:
every file in a restic repo is named by the SHA-256 of its own contents, so
integrity is a matter of re-hashing and comparing to the filename. Running
`restic check` there instead would put the key next to the ciphertext and undo
the property the whole design rests on -- that s3g holds data it cannot read.

It publishes JSON through `fleet_metrics_server.py` (allowlist already accepts
`watchdog_*.json`), and `syncthing_offsite_status.sh` fails if s3g reports
damage or if the report goes stale past 45 days.

## The RAM fault (found by this work, unrelated to its design)

The very first backup failed:

```
Detected data corruption while saving blob 807d43ac… : hash mismatch
```

restic hashes each blob when chunking, then re-verifies after compress+encrypt
before writing. A mismatch means the data changed **in memory**, not on disk.

Diagnosis: three cold reads of the source file (caches dropped) hashed identically,
ruling out the NVMe. A rerun failed at a **different file and a different blob**,
ruling out a restic bug or a bad file — non-deterministic, therefore hardware. Both
runs died after ~35–40 GB processed, i.e. a roughly fixed error rate per byte.

Cause: **four mismatched DIMMs across all four slots** on an ASRock B450 Steel
Legend with a Ryzen 5 5500 — Crucial 2133, Kingston HyperX 2400 ×2, G.Skill 2666,
all clocked down to 2133. Not an overclock; AM4's memory controller is simply weak
with four heterogeneous modules, and fails under sustained all-core memory pressure.
No ECC, so nothing in the OS was ever going to report it.

Fix: removed the Crucial and G.Skill sticks, leaving the matched Kingston pair
(16 GB) already in A2/B2. The backup then ran 137 seconds — well past the 80–100 s
failure point — and has verified clean since.

**Open consequence:** bad memory was in play while `--delete` mirrors ran nightly to
FleetNAS and Mac Mini. rsync compares size and mtime, not content, so corruption
would have propagated silently. An `rsync -ainc` checksum dry-run against FleetNAS
would settle it — expensive (85 GB read at both ends), worth doing, not urgent.
Note also that restic verifies faithfully what it *stored*; it cannot tell you a
photo was already damaged on disk when it read it.

The two removed sticks are kept and untested. Worth memtesting before deciding
between a matched 32 GB kit and staying on 16 GB. Current usage is ~2 GB.

## Scripts

All in `~/repos/scripts/WorkBenchUnix/`.

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `backup_immich_to_restic.sh` | nightly backup, forget, monthly prune, check |
| `syncthing_offsite_status.sh` | off-site replication check for the summary |
| `restic-wbu` | wrapper — `sudo restic-wbu snapshots`, `… prune`, `… restore …` |
| `init-restic-repo.sh` | one-off: repo + passphrase file (passphrase never echoed) |
| `install-restic.sh` | restic 0.19.1 from upstream, checksum-verified |
| `install-syncthing.sh` | Syncthing from upstream apt, prepares the repo folder |
| `fix-restic-perms-for-syncthing.sh` | one-off: `a+rX` so the daemon can read |
| `mount-esp.sh` | one-off: pin the ESP in fstab |
| `add-restic-cron.sh`, `add-syncthing-cron.sh` | guarded crontab edits |
| `nightly_summary.sh` | modified: LOGS, EXPECTED, LABEL, staleness, TLDR lines |

Destructive and cron-touching scripts back up first and roll back on failure.

Five single-use scripts were deleted after the work was done, because each was
guarded against state that no longer exists and would now refuse to run:
`recon-sudo.sh` and `recon-p3.sh` (surveyed the Windows partition),
`reformat-p3-restic.sh` (required NTFS + the old UUID), `rename-restic-mount.sh`
(required `/mnt/restic`), and `diagnose-restic-corruption.sh` (hardcoded to the
one file and blob from the RAM incident). What they found and did is recorded
above, including the diagnostic method for the last one.

---

## Retrieving from the repo

All reads go *through* restic, never by opening the directory:

```
sudo restic-wbu snapshots                                  # list backups
sudo restic-wbu ls latest                                  # browse a snapshot
sudo restic-wbu restore latest --include <path> --target /tmp/out
sudo restic-wbu dump latest <path> > out                   # stream one file
sudo restic-wbu mount /mnt/restic-browse                   # FUSE, read-only
```

At the s3g end, `restic -r D:\Immich …` with the passphrase. FUSE mount is
Linux/macOS only.

---

## Open items

### 1. Passphrase copy outside Amsterdam — CRITICAL, unresolved

`/root/.restic-passphrase` sits on the same machine, in the same building, as the
data it protects. The Gran Canaria copy is mathematically undecryptable without it.
restic has no recovery key, no reset, no support channel.

**Never `cat` that file inside a Claude Code session** — it lands in the transcript
and the local `.jsonl`.

Verify memory matches the file, interactively, without printing anything:

```
sudo restic -r /mnt/immich-backup/restic snapshots
```

Bare `restic`, not `restic-wbu` — the wrapper sets `RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE` and would
skip the prompt.

**Consider a second key.** restic allows multiple passphrases on one repo, any of
which opens it:

```
sudo restic-wbu key add        # then: restic-wbu key list
```

That allows a short memorable phrase for typing at the GC end *and* a long random
one in a password manager, so the weak one is not the only thing protecting the
repo. The current passphrase is under 12 characters, accepted deliberately per the
original decision that encryption here is mandatory rather than desired — but that
decision assumed the repo stayed on one machine, which is no longer true.

Record the repo path, the fact that it is restic, and where to get the binary — not
just the passphrase. A bare secret with no context is far less useful in two years.

Store it in a password manager that syncs off-device **and** on paper at the GC
location. Both: the manager covers convenience, the paper covers "I cannot log into
anything because the laptop was in the house too."

### 2. Verify the s3g copy once seeded

Only once the folder shows **Up to Date** — checking a partial repo reports missing
packs and tells you nothing.

Install `restic_0.19.1_windows_amd64.zip` from the same GitHub release, then:

```
restic.exe -r D:\Immich snapshots       # passphrase works, repo opens
restic.exe -r D:\Immich check           # every referenced pack present
restic.exe -r D:\Immich restore latest --include <one photo> --target C:\tmp\proof
```

The first is the moment the off-site copy stops being theoretical. The third is the
one that matters emotionally: structure checks are abstractions, a photo on screen
is not.

**Expected gotcha:** restic takes a lock, creating a file under `locks/`. That
folder is Receive Only, so Syncthing flags a *"Locally Changed Item"*. Harmless —
`/locks` is in `.stignore` and never syncs back. Let Syncthing revert it or delete
it. Worth knowing in advance so it does not read as corruption.

A full `check --read-data` re-hashes all 85 GiB; worth doing once, overnight, after
the cheap checks pass.

### 3. Syncthing snapshots for the other boxes

**s3g first.** wbu's config records that it *sends* to s3g. Nothing anywhere records
what s3g *does with it* — the `D:\Immich` path, the Receive Only type, or
that the drive migrates to sgc around January 2027. If s3g died, the receiving half
would be rebuilt from memory.

For `Surface3GC/surface3-gc-snapshot-fleet-configs.ps1`: read
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Syncthing\config.xml`, cast to `[xml]`, null out `gui.apikey` and
`gui.password`, verify the originals are absent from the output, save, and write the
same topology summary as the WBU version.

mmm and mb2 are macOS (config under `~/Library/Application Support/Syncthing/`,
snapshot scripts are `.sh`, so the Python approach ports if python3 is present).
rws is Windows like s3g.

### 4. FleetNAS checksum audit

Bad memory was in play while `--delete` mirrors ran nightly (see the RAM section).
rsync compares size and mtime, so a corrupted byte would have propagated silently.
Force content comparison, dry run — write it to a script rather than pasting:

```
rsync -ain --no-perms --delete -c -e "ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_fleetnas" \
    /mnt/immich-data/immich/images/ dhm@192.168.178.123:immich/images/
```

`-c` is the only addition to the verification pass
`backup_immich_images_to_fleetnas.sh` already runs. Reads 85 GiB at both ends;
budget hours. Empty output means FleetNAS matches wbu byte-for-byte — and since the
restic repo verified clean against that same source, the chain holds.

**What it cannot tell you:** whether a photo was already corrupt before it ever
reached wbu.

### 5. Memtest the two removed DIMMs

Test them **individually**, not as a pair — the fault may have been the combination
rather than any single module. Boot memtest86+ with only the Crucial in A2, then
only the G.Skill. If both pass alone, the four-DIMM configuration was the problem,
and a matched 32 GB kit can be bought with confidence rather than replacing sticks
blind. Current usage is ~2 GB of 16 GB, so there is no hurry.

### 6. Additional replica: rws (Philly)

Only after s3g reads 100%. **Do not seed two remotes at once** — they share one
Amsterdam uplink, halving each and extending the window with no completed off-site
copy.

Then: pair wbu with rws, share the same `immich-restic` folder, Receive Only at that
end, ~90 GB free required. Different continent, so it covers the case where
Amsterdam and Gran Canaria are hit by the same event. Already in mmm's Syncthing
mesh, so no new software to install.

mb2 skipped: same city as wbu, so it buys no regional separation, and 85 GiB on a
MacBook Air duplicates what s3g already holds.

### 7. Smaller items

- **`fleet-configs` snapshot** — fstab, root crontab, Syncthing and `/usr/local/bin`
  all changed 2026-08-25. Run `wbu-snapshot-fleet-configs.sh` locally (needs `sudo`
  for the root crontab) and review before committing.
- **Syncthing version skew** — wbu 1.30.0, s3g 2.1.3. Interoperating fine; align
  eventually.
- **Tighten `BACKLOG_MAX_DAYS`** if a genuine large import repeatedly trips the
  3-day limit — or leave it, and treat a trip as worth investigating.

## Edit log

**2026-08-25 UTC — Created.** Off-site approach settled: restic on wbu + Syncthing
to s3g D: (→ sgc Jan 2027). Supersedes Next-Level Plan Workstream A1. Google Drive
too tight at ~153 GB free; OneDrive ruled out on 100k-small-file handling; restic
chosen for versioning + integrity despite mandatory encryption and repo opacity.

**2026-08-25 UTC — Built.** Repo location resolved (`/mnt/immich-backup/restic` on
p3, reclaimed from Windows). Retention set to 14/8/24. Derived data excluded,
dropping the backup set from ~118 GB to ~89 GiB. Prune set monthly to avoid
Syncthing churn. Cron at 04:00 and 06:25. Summary integration with three-state
off-site reporting. Syncthing installed on wbu — the original doc's claim that it
was already deployed there was wrong. Corrected the claim that the 1am backup-c job
was failing: it was deliberately disabled 2026-07-22. **A four-DIMM memory fault was
found and fixed during the first backup** — see above. Initial seed to s3g started
~21:00 local, ETA ~8 h.
