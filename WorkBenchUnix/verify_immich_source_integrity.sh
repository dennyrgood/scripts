# verify_immich_source_integrity.sh — verify every Immich original on disk
# against the SHA-1 Immich recorded when it ingested the file.
# Created: 2026-08-28.
#
# WHY THIS IS THE LAYER THAT WAS MISSING
#   restic verifies its own repo, Syncthing verifies what it transfers, and
#   audit_mirror_checksums.sh verifies the rsync mirrors. Every one of those
#   compares a copy against WBU's current file. None can tell you WBU's file
#   is still what it was.
#
#   That matters because restic faithfully backs up whatever it reads. If an
#   original rots on this disk, restic stores the rotten version, verifies it
#   perfectly, replicates it to Gran Canaria, and every check reports green.
#   Immich's database holds the only independent record of the original bytes.
#
# COST
#   Reads and hashes ~85 GiB from NVMe. A few minutes. Cheap enough to run
#   weekly; there is no reason to sample.
