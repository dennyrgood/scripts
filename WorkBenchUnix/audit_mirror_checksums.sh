# audit_mirror_checksums.sh — content audit of an Immich mirror.
#
#   audit_mirror_checksums.sh fleetnas|macmini [--fix]
#
# Created: 2026-08-28. Renamed from audit_fleetnas_checksums.sh when the Mac
# Mini needed the same treatment: the two destinations differ in four
# variables, and the interesting logic — rsync's itemise flags and which side
# to trust — is fiddly enough that having one copy of it matters more than
# matching the per-destination style of the backup scripts.
#
# WHY
#   Between roughly 2026-06 and 2026-08-25, WBU ran four mismatched DIMMs that
#   corrupted data in flight (see OFFSITE_BACKUP.md, "The RAM fault"). Both
#   mirrors ran throughout with --delete. rsync compares SIZE and MTIME, not
#   content, so a corrupted byte propagated silently and the nightly
#   verification still reported "0 differences".
#
#   Confirmed on 2026-08-28: one file of 140,752 differed between WBU and
#   FleetNAS with identical size and mtime. Immich's ingest checksum matched
#   WBU, so FleetNAS held the damaged copy. No ordinary sync would ever have
#   repaired it.
#
# SAFETY
#   Dry run unless --fix is given. Nothing at the destination is written,
#   moved or deleted without it.

# size, same mtime, different bytes, exactly the shape memory corruption
# leaves. An earlier version matched '^>f..c', wrong on both the direction
# character and the offset, and reported 0 while a real mismatch sat in the

# The checksum flag alone is NOT the corruption signature: it must come with

# means the source was legitimately rewritten after the last sync -- different
# mtime -- and the next ordinary sync transfers it anyway. On 2026-09-15 all six
# "mismatches" to the weekly-synced Mac Mini were exactly that: Immich's
# per-folder .immich markers, whose content is the epoch-ms time Immich last
# started, rewritten by a restart on 09-11 hours after that Friday's sync.
# Real corruption from the RAM fault keeps rsync's copied mtime: '<fc........'.
