#!/bin/bash
# backup_immich_to_restic.sh — nightly restic snapshot of the Immich library
# into the local repo on /mnt/immich-backup, which Syncthing then replicates
# off-site to s3g (Gran Canaria).
#
# Created: 2026-08-25.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   FleetNAS and Mac Mini already hold mirrors of the library, but they are
#   `rsync --delete` mirrors: a bad deletion or a corrupted file propagates to
#   them within 24h and the previous good state is gone. This adds the one
#   thing a mirror cannot give — point-in-time rollback — plus integrity
#   checking of what was actually stored.
#
# WHAT IS NOT BACKED UP, AND WHY
#   thumbs/ (20G) and encoded-video/ (1.9G) are derived data. Immich rebuilds
#   both from the originals. Backing them up would add ~22G to the repo and,
#   more to the point, ~22G to the initial over-the-wire seed to Gran Canaria
#   and to every prune-driven re-replication after that.
#   backups/ (8.4G) is Immich's own DB dump. postgres-dumps-latest/ already
#   holds a pg_dumpall of the whole cluster, which is strictly more complete,
#   so including both just stores the database twice.
#   Cost of these exclusions: after a full restore, Immich regenerates
#   thumbnails and transcodes for ~280k assets. That takes hours, runs
#   unattended, and touches nothing irreplaceable. Set BACKUP_DERIVED=yes
#   below to include them anyway.
#
# WHY PRUNE IS NOT NIGHTLY
#   `forget` only deletes small snapshot metadata files — cheap, and nearly
#   invisible to Syncthing. `prune` rewrites pack files, which means Syncthing
#   must re-transfer every repacked pack to Gran Canaria. On a slow link that
#   is the dominant cost of the whole design, so prune runs monthly, not
#   nightly. Space allows it: ~244G of volume for a repo expected around 90G.

set -u

# Explicit: restic packs must be readable by the syncthing daemon (runs as dhm).
# Inheriting cron's umask would silently create unreadable packs.

# -- errored files are excluded from its completion figure -- and the four it

# between a stale backup and an unrestorable one.
#
# So normalise explicitly rather than depending on what restic chose. a+rX adds
# read for all and traverse on directories only, never +x on a data file. It is
# a stat+chmod over ~5k entries, well under a second, and safe to repeat.

# silently excluded from the completion figure and the copy was quietly
# unrestorable. Bytes still outstanding do NOT fail it -- the backup itself is
# good, a large import legitimately takes longer than this window, and
# syncthing_offsite_status.sh owns that judgement with its backlog-age limit.
