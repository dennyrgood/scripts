.SYNOPSIS
  Standalone WiFi-flap diagnostic heartbeat for TravelBeast.

.PURPOSE
  TravelBeast's onboard WiFi (Realtek RTL8852BE, 5GHz, oLiFaNt_5G) has been
  intermittently flaky since at least 2026-07-27: amsterdamdesktop's and
  chatworkhorse's fleet checkers see repeated ping-timeout/high-latency
  cycles while this box's own uptime is unaffected - i.e. reachability
  drops, the machine itself doesn't.

  Manual investigation on 2026-07-27/28 (see chat history) found:
    - Signal/RSSI/BSSID/channel rock-stable throughout (87-89%, -56dBm,
      BSSID 28:ee:52:...:07:86, channel 48) even during multi-second
      latency spikes - so it isn't a weak-signal or roaming/AP-hopping
      problem in the usual sense.
    - Standard NDIS device power management ("allow the computer to turn
      off this device") is Unsupported on this driver - ruled out.
    - Leisure Power Save (Realtek chip-level radio doze) set Auto->Low:
      no measurable improvement.
    - Multi-Channel Concurrent set Enabled->Disabled: no measurable
      improvement.
    - Switching 5GHz->2.4GHz: no difference (rules out band/channel
      congestion).
    - Other devices (Mac/Win11) on the same AP at the same time: clean -
      rules out the router/environment, confirms TravelBeast-specific.
    - Uninstalling/reinstalling the Wi-Fi device in Device Manager (which
      resets per-instance driver parameters to default) produced a large,
      sustained improvement: pre-reinstall pings routinely hit 400ms-3.9s
      with ~25% loss; post-reinstall settled to a steady 1-10ms baseline
      with only isolated single-packet timeouts remaining, initially on a
      suspiciously tight ~40-45s cadence (suggestive of periodic
      background roam-scanning).
    - Roaming Sensitivity Level set Middle->Low: the ~40-45s periodic
      timeout cadence broke up into irregular, infrequent single losses
      (multi-minute clean stretches became common) - no more severe
      multi-second spikes observed since.
    - WLAN-AutoConfig/Dhcp-Client/Ndis System-log events were empty
      throughout every bad stretch captured - the OS never logged a real
      disconnect or DHCP renewal, meaning the flakiness happens below the
      level Windows' own connectivity logging notices. Event 11010
      ("Wireless security started", fired on every WLAN reconnect/re-auth)
      from the WLAN-AutoConfig/Operational log is a finer-grained signal
      than System log and is what this script tracks going forward, per
      the same approach used on RemoteWS (see
      ..\RemoteWS\power-heartbeat.ps1) for its own unrelated WiFi-flap
      investigation.

  As of this writing the working theory is stale/corrupted per-device
  driver state (fixed by the reinstall) plus overly-aggressive roam
  scanning (mitigated by Roaming Sensitivity=Low), but the isolated
  single-packet losses haven't been fully eliminated and the fix hasn't
  been observed across a full multi-day cycle yet. This script exists so
  the next occurrence has a local trend line (signal/RSSI/reconnect
  events) to correlate against the fleet checker's own outage log,
  instead of requiring another manual multi-hour diagnostic session.

  2026-09-11 UTC (v4): added a ping to a fleet peer's Tailscale IP
  (amsterdamdesktop, 100.125.37.114), distinct from the existing WAN
  ping. Prompted by a night of tb-health-monitor.ps1 "Fleet Metrics
  Watchdog" alert/all-clear flapping - this log's own gateway/WAN
  columns showed WAN was solid the entire night, which cleared TB's raw
  internet connectivity but said nothing about whether the *tunnel*
  (the actual path the fleet checker/health-monitor system reaches this
  box over) was ever dropping, since 1.1.1.1 is reached over the plain
  WiFi default route, not through Tailscale. This column closes that
  gap: it's the same kind of blind spot as gateway-vs-WAN before it,
  one layer further in.

  2026-08-19 blind spot found and closed (v2, then v3 schema): oLiFaNt_5G
  died sometime that afternoon while this log showed nothing wrong at all
  - uninterrupted "connected" state, stable BSSID/signal/RSSI, zero
  reconnect events, right up until the user's own manual
  disconnect/reconnect attempts started showing up in the WLAN-AutoConfig
  event log. The v1 schema only records what Windows *reports* about the
  link (signal/state/reconnect-count), which looks identical whether the
  link is healthy or "connected but not actually passing traffic" - the
  same silent-death signature as the original problem this script was
  built to catch. v2 added a gateway-only reachability probe; v3 (same
  day, mirroring the equivalent RemoteWS fix - see
  ..\RemoteWS\power-heartbeat.ps1) adds a second ping to a fixed public
  IP so a future outage can be told apart as AP/local-network vs.
  upstream/ISP, using the same column names as RemoteWS's copy for
  cross-machine consistency. Gateway is re-detected every tick since this
  is a travel laptop and the gateway changes across networks.

  This script appends one line every 15s to a local, append-only, per-day
  log file, synchronously flushed on every tick so a crash/reboot can't
  lose a buffered-but-unwritten line. It is intentionally independent of
  the existing Fleet Metrics Server / Watchdog tasks (see
  Status/readme.md) so a problem with those doesn't also take this out.

.NOTES
  Deploy via Scheduled Task "Power Heartbeat Logger" (At system startup,
  runs as SYSTEM so it doesn't need an interactive logon to start - see
  the "Fleet Metrics Server" task, which only starts once someone logs
  in).
  Logs to C:\fleet_monitor\power_heartbeat_travelbeast\ alongside the
  existing fleet_monitor heartbeat/metrics files for this host.

  Schema note: 2026-08-19 added gw_ping_ms/gw_ping_status (v2), then the
  same day switched to gateway_ip/gateway_ping_ok/gateway_ping_ms/
  wan_ping_ok/wan_ping_ms (v3) to match RemoteWS's column names and add
  the WAN-side check. 2026-09-11 added tailscale_peer_ip/
  tailscale_peer_ping_ok/tailscale_peer_ping_ms (v4) - this one has no
  RemoteWS equivalent (yet), it's TB-specific for now. Older day-files
  only have the earlier column sets - don't concatenate across versions
  without accounting for the header change, hence the versioned
  "power_heartbeat_v{2,3,4}_*" filename prefixes (same convention as
  RemoteWS's copy of this script). Editing this file does NOT affect an
  already-running instance - PowerShell loads the whole script into
  memory at start, so the running "Power Heartbeat Logger" task must be
  stopped and restarted (Task Scheduler -> right-click -> End, then Run)
  to pick up changes.
