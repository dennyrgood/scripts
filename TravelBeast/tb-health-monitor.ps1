# TravelBeast\tb-health-monitor.ps1
# 2026-08-31 UTC -- created, modeled on ImageBeast/ib-health-monitor.ps1. Same shape:
# missing/down per service, streak-based anti-flap, alert on first detection + every
# 30 min while active, all-clear on resolution, silent when healthy.
#
# Services checked here are tb's REAL scheduled tasks/processes, confirmed 2026-08-31
# via Get-ScheduledTask + Get-NetTCPConnection + Win32_Process CommandLine:
#   Ollama -> ollama.exe serve   :11434
#
# tb has NO ComfyUI process/task running as of this check (unlike ib/cwh) -- per
# Status/readme.md, tb's ComfyUI has "no public URLs" and this is a travel laptop
# (role: Mobile/Travel), so ComfyUI is evidently started manually/occasionally rather
# than always-on. Deliberately NOT monitored here: alerting on an intentionally-absent
# service would just be noise. If ComfyUI is ever made always-on here, add it the same
# way ib's health-monitor does.
#
# NOT re-checked here (deliberately -- each already has its own auto-healing or
# logging elsewhere; this script's job is to alert when THAT mechanism is failing,
# not duplicate it):
#   Fleet Metrics Server (:9100) / Heartbeat Writer -- self-healed every 5 min by
#     Status\FleetMetricsWatchdog.ps1, which never emails. Checked below via its own
#     last-task-result + staleness only.
#   Power Heartbeat Logger -- TravelBeast's own WiFi-flap diagnostic
#     (TravelBeast\power-heartbeat.ps1), logs signal/reconnect events to its own log
#     file, never emails. Checked the same "watch the watchdog" way: last-task-result
#     + staleness, since losing this diagnostic silently would blind any future
#     WiFi-flap investigation the same way a dead heartbeat writer blinds the fleet
#     dashboard.
#
# tb has no Fleet Checker / Fleet Status API / OpenWebUI / Cloudflared Tunnel tasks and
# no UPS-watch task (confirmed via Get-ScheduledTask, not assumed from other boxes).
#
# Requires this task to run with highest privileges (Win32_Process's CommandLine
# comes back blank for other-session processes otherwise).
#
# ASCII only -- PowerShell 5.1 has no BOM handling and mis-decodes non-ASCII (CLAUDE.md).

# meant to just keep running for days without restarting, so "LastRunTime" (which
# only advances on an actual restart) is the WRONG signal for "is it still working" --
# confirmed on 2026-09-01/02 that a healthy, continuously-running instance (State
# still Running, CSV still getting fresh ~16s writes the whole time) tripped the old
# ">25h since last restart" check purely because uptime crossed 25h, firing real
# HEALTH ALERT emails every 30 min for hours over something that was never actually
# broken. Checking the CSV's own freshness (like RemoteWS's equivalent check) measures
# the thing that actually matters -- is data still being written -- not how long ago
# the task process happened to start.
#
# 2026-09-02 UTC -- second fix, same day: the first version looked for TODAY's file
# by exact date-matched filename, which false-fired again at midnight -- the logger
# hadn't rolled over to the new day's CSV in the first seconds after 00:00 yet, so
# "today's" exact-named file didn't exist even though yesterday's was still getting
# written moments earlier. RemoteWS's equivalent check already avoided this (find the
# MOST RECENT CSV by write time, not by exact filename) -- should have copied that
# pattern the first time instead of the fragile exact-match version.

# fired an email and the very next clean check immediately fired the all-clear.

WHAT THESE ALERTS MEAN AND WHAT TO DO
------------------------------------------------------------------------

<SVC> MISSING / NOT RESPONDING:
Process gone, or running but its HTTP endpoint isn't answering. Requires
$FailThreshold consecutive checks (~$($FailThreshold * 5) min) before alerting.

What to do:
  1. Get-ScheduledTask | Where-Object TaskName -match '<task name>'
  2. schtasks /Run /TN "<task name>"

FLEET METRICS WATCHDOG TROUBLE:
Status\FleetMetricsWatchdog.ps1 self-heals Fleet Metrics Server and Heartbeat
Writer every 5 min but never emails -- this alert means its own restart
attempts failed, or it hasn't run recently.

What to do:
  1. Get-Content C:\fleet_monitor\watchdog_$HostName.log -Tail 50
  2. schtasks /Query /TN "Fleet Metrics Watchdog" /V /FO LIST

POWER HEARTBEAT LOGGER TROUBLE:
TravelBeast\power-heartbeat.ps1 is this box's own WiFi-flap diagnostic --
losing it silently means a future WiFi investigation has no trend line to
correlate against, the same way a dead heartbeat writer blinds the fleet
dashboard. This fires if the task itself isn't Running, or if the most
recent CSV sample is more than 20 min old (expected every ~16s while active).

What to do:
  1. schtasks /Query /TN "Power Heartbeat Logger" /V /FO LIST
  2. Get-ChildItem C:\fleet_monitor\power_heartbeat_travelbeast | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select -First 1
  3. schtasks /Run /TN "Power Heartbeat Logger"
