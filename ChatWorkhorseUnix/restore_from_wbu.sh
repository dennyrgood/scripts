# Created: 2026-06-27 10:42 UTC — warm-sync job: ChatWorkhorseUnix pulls from WorkBenchUnix
# Edited: 2026-06-27 — fixed completion-marker check: "cluster dump complete", not "dump complete"
# Edited: 2026-06-30 UTC — switched source from WBU's backup-c to WBU's win-d (live data).
# Trigger: backup-c's drive was found failing (SMART extended self-test failure, growing
# pending sectors — see Immich-Backup-Strategy-Present-and-Future.md, "Drive Health
# Incident"). Images now read from win-d/immich/images/ directly (the live source, healthy,
# no dated-folder wrapper needed). DB dump now reads from win-d/immich/postgres-dumps-latest/,
# produced by the new standalone dump_immich_db_for_cwhu.sh (5:30am), independent of any
# backup drive's health. No other logic changed — format, completion marker, and restore
# steps are unchanged since the dump is still pg_dumpall, uncompressed, same as before.
# Runs ON ChatWorkhorseUnix, triggered by CWHU's own cron (6am daily). Destructive by
# design — see runbook v6.6.
# 2026-06-30 UTC: WBU renamed its win-d mount to immich-data; updated remote-facing
# references (ssh/rsync targets) below to match.
# 2026-06-30 UTC: CWHU also renamed its own local win-d mount to immich-data (separate
# mount, separate UUID, on /dev/sdb1 — a VM vdi). LIVE_IMAGES, DUMP_STAGING, and the
# local Postgres wipe path below updated to match. Both machines now use immich-data
# consistently; no win-d mounts remain on either host.
# 2026-07-14 15:30 UTC: Save psql restore log to ~/.cache/cwhu-warm-sync/ with datestamp (alongside sync_log/sync_errors), replacing ephemeral /tmp path.
# 2026-07-22 UTC: Root-caused a ~2hr Immich outage — WBU had a transient SSH hang, and
# the bare `ssh` call below (no ConnectTimeout/keepalive) sat there indefinitely, never
# reaching the "no dump found" guard, so the stack stayed torn down with no recovery and
# no error surfaced. Added SSH_OPTS (applied to the ssh call and every rsync's transport,
# since rsync can hang mid-transfer the same way) so any future connectivity blip to WBU
# fails within ~25s instead of hanging forever, and switched the LATEST_DUMP assignment to
# explicit error-checking so set -e can't skip past the recovery block on failure.
# 2026-07-23 UTC: Second outage, different step — WBU was itself in I/O distress (RCU
# stalls), which corrupted the SSH transport mid-image-rsync ("message authentication
# code incorrect"). That step had no recovery block (only the dump-list/verify steps
# did), so the stack stayed down with nothing to bring it back up. Fixed two ways:
#   1. Added a preflight WBU health check (iowait + D-state, same signal/thresholds
#      wbu-health-monitor.sh alerts on) before anything destructive happens. If WBU is
#      unreachable or already struggling, skip the run entirely and never touch CWHU's
#      running stack.
#   2. Replaced the per-step manual "docker compose up -d; exit 1" recovery blocks with
#      a single trap on EXIT, gated by STACK_DOWN. That way *any* failure after the
#      stack comes down — not just the two steps someone remembered to guard — brings
#      it back up.
# 2026-07-28 UTC: Third outage — the wipe-then-restore left Immich showing the
# first-run "create admin user" screen. The pg_isready readiness check below matched
# the postgres image's short-lived TEMPORARY init server (Unix socket only) instead of
# the real one, so the restore got piped into a connection that was killed seconds
# later when the temp server shut down, leaving Postgres empty. Fixed by forcing
# pg_isready onto TCP (-h 127.0.0.1), which the temp server never listens on. See the
# comment at the pg_isready line for the full mechanism. Recovered manually by
# restoring the still-staged dump into the live container (no wipe needed) after
# DROP DATABASE immich to undo the schema Immich had auto-migrated onto the empty DB.
