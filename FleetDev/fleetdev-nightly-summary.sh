# Created: 2026-08-30 UTC (cloned to FleetDev 2026-09-18) — daily health summary email
# for FleetDev, modeled on MathesMacMini/nightly_summary.sh but scoped to what actually
# runs on THIS box. No UPS/Plex/Syncthing sections — none of that runs here. The one
# scheduled (non-KeepAlive) job on this box, comfy-fleet-scan (daily 05:00), gets
# its own freshness check here, the same role mmm's nightly script gives the Plex
# sync log — fleetdev-health-monitor.sh deliberately excludes it since a once-daily
# StartCalendarInterval job is "missing" 23:55 hours a day by design.
#
# Sends via msmtp (iCloud SMTP, ~/.msmtprc) — see the mmm/WBU runbooks under
# WorkBenchUnix/RUNBOOK_msmtp-credential-rotation.md for credential setup/rotation.
# Run via launchd, which gets a minimal PATH, so msmtp is called by full Homebrew
# path throughout.

# 2026-09-04: briefly padded to 43200s (12h) after the identical bug surfaced on mb2
# (StartInterval launchd jobs don't fire/catch up during sleep, so a normal overnight
# sleep alone falsely flagged mb-health-monitor as stale). Reverted to a tight-ish
# threshold on the understanding that mb, like mb2, is always on AC power with the lid
# never closed and should also get `sudo pmset -a sleep 0 standby 0 powernap 0` run on
# it directly (that command was run on mb2 as part of this fix — confirm/run it on mb
# too if not already done). Padded a bit past the 5-min run interval to absorb ordinary
# scheduling jitter, not to ride out sleep.

                         # mmm's reasoning for its own padded threshold.
