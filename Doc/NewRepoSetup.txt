# Guide: Creating and Syncing a New GitHub Repository (HTTPS Method)

This guide outlines the most reliable method for creating a new repository that works seamlessly with your macOS command-line interface (CLI) and uses the HTTPS protocol to avoid SSH authentication errors.

This is the recommended method for starting a new project or putting an existing local folder under Git control.

## Part 1: Initial Setup (GitHub Website)

The first step is always to create an empty destination on GitHub.

1. **Go to GitHub**: Open GitHub.com and sign in.
2. **Create New Repo**: Click the + sign in the top-right corner, then select New repository.
3. **Name and Settings**:
   - Repository Name: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., MyNewProject).
   - Visibility: Set to Private or Public as needed.
   - Initialization (CRUCIAL): DO NOT check any boxes (like "Add a README file").
4. **Click Create repository**.
5. **Get the HTTPS URL**: On the next screen, click the < > Code button and ensure the HTTPS tab is selected. Copy the full URL. It will look like this:

   ```
   https://github.com/dennyrgood/MyNewProject.git
   ```

## Part 2: Local Setup (macOS Terminal)

Use the following process depending on whether you are starting a brand new project or converting an existing folder.

### Scenario A: Starting a Brand New Project (Recommended)

This is the cleanest method as it handles all folder creation and settings automatically.

1. **Navigate to the Parent Directory**: Go to where you want the new folder to live:

   ```bash
   cd ~/repos
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**: Use the HTTPS URL you copied in Part 1. This creates the folder, downloads the basic Git files, and sets up the remote connection.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dennyrgood/MyNewProject.git
   ```

3. **Start Working**:

   ```bash
   cd MyNewProject
   # Create a new file (e.g., 'touch README.md')
   # Now run the first push to align tracking (required for empty remotes):
   git push -u origin main 

   # You can now create more files and run sync-all
   ```

### Scenario B: Putting an Existing Folder under Git Control

Use this only if you already have files in a folder and want to track them.

1. **Navigate to Existing Folder**:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/my/existing/folder
   ```

2. **Initialize Git Locally**:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Add and Commit Files**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit of existing files"
   ```

4. **Connect to Remote and Push**: Use the HTTPS URL from Part 1. (This step includes the necessary branch name correction):

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/dennyrgood/MyNewProject.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Part 3: Adding the New Repo to sync-all.sh

For your new repository to sync automatically, you must add its name to the REPOS array inside your sync-all.sh script.

1. **Open**: sync-all.sh
2. **Edit the Array**: Add the name (e.g., MyNewProject) to the list:

   ```bash
   REPOS=(
       "dennyrgood.github.io"
       "excel-web-interface"
       "google-photos"
       "llm"
       "movies-shows-editor"
       "place-objects"
       "scripts"
       "usdz-avp"
       "weather-dashboard"
       "MyNewProject"  # <-- Add the new repository name here
   )
   ```

Now, every time you run sync-all.sh, your new repo will be automatically committed, pulled, and pushed.

## Updated Repository Names (as of Nov 2024)

All repositories now use kebab-case naming:
- ✅ `dennyrgood.github.io` (special case - GitHub Pages requirement)
- ✅ `excel-web-interface`
- ✅ `google-photos` (was GooglePhotos)
- ✅ `llm` (was LLM)
- ✅ `movies-shows-editor` (was MoviesShowsFullEdit)
- ✅ `place-objects` (was PlaceObjects)
- ✅ `scripts` (was Scripts)
- ✅ `usdz-avp` (was USDZ_AVP)
- ✅ `weather-dashboard`

All repositories are located in `~/repos` (was `~/Documents/MyWebsiteGIT`)
