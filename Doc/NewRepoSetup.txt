📚 Guide: Creating and Syncing a New GitHub Repository (HTTPS Method)This guide outlines the most reliable method for creating a new repository that works seamlessly with your macOS command-line interface (CLI) and uses the HTTPS protocol to avoid SSH authentication errors.This is the recommended method for starting a new project or putting an existing local folder under Git control.Part 1: Initial Setup (GitHub Website)The first step is always to create an empty destination on GitHub.Go to GitHub: Open GitHub.com and sign in.Create New Repo: Click the + sign in the top-right corner, then select New repository.Name and Settings:Repository Name: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., MyNewProject).Visibility: Set to Private or Public as needed.Initialization (CRUCIAL): DO NOT check any boxes (like "Add a README file").Click Create repository.Get the HTTPS URL: On the next screen, click the < > Code button and ensure the HTTPS tab is selected. Copy the full URL. It will look like this:[https://github.com/dennyrgood/MyNewProject.git](https://github.com/dennyrgood/MyNewProject.git)
Part 2: Local Setup (macOS Terminal)Use the following process depending on whether you are starting a brand new project or converting an existing folder.Scenario A: Starting a Brand New Project (Recommended)This is the cleanest method as it handles all folder creation and settings automatically.Navigate to the Parent Directory: Go to where you want the new folder to live (e.g., /Users/dennishmathes/Documents/MyWebSiteGIT/):cd /Users/dennishmathes/Documents/MyWebSiteGIT
Clone the Repository: Use the HTTPS URL you copied in Part 1. This creates the folder, downloads the basic Git files, and sets up the remote connection.git clone [https://github.com/dennyrgood/MyNewProject.git](https://github.com/dennyrgood/MyNewProject.git)
Start Working:cd MyNewProject
# Create a new file (e.g., 'touch README.md')
# Now run the first push to align tracking (required for empty remotes):
git push -u origin main 

# You can now create more files and run syncall.sh
Scenario B: Putting an Existing Folder under Git ControlUse this only if you already have files in a folder and want to track them.Navigate to Existing Folder:cd /path/to/my/existing/folder
Initialize Git Locally:git init
Add and Commit Files:git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of existing files"
Connect to Remote and Push: Use the HTTPS URL from Part 1. (This step includes the necessary branch name correction):git remote add origin [https://github.com/dennyrgood/MyNewProject.git](https://github.com/dennyrgood/MyNewProject.git)
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Part 3: Adding the New Repo to enhanced_sync.shFor your new repository to sync automatically, you must add its name to the REPOS array inside your enhanced_sync.sh script.Open: enhanced_sync.shEdit the Array: Add the name (e.g., Doc or MyNewProject) to the list (Note: Your current sync-all.sh automatically finds all Git repos, so this step might be optional depending on which version you use, but it's good practice for clarity):REPOS=(
    "dennyrgood.github.io"
    "USDZ_AVP"
    "weather-dashboard"
    "Doc" # <-- Add the new repository name here
)
Now, every time you run enhanced_sync.sh, your new repo will be automatically committed, pulled, and pushed.
