# FleetMetricsWatchdog.ps1
#
# Hardens both halves of the fleet-metrics pipeline on this box:
#   1. Fleet Metrics Server (serves fleet_monitor/ over HTTP on port 9100)
#   2. Heartbeat Writer     (writes heartbeat_/machine_info_/metrics_history_ files)
#
# A server that's down/hung fails the HTTP check outright. A writer that's died
# (process gone, but server still up) looks like a normal 200 OK with a heartbeat
# timestamp that stops advancing - so the two need separate detection and separate
# fixes: restarting the server does nothing for a dead writer, and vice versa.
#
# Task DISPLAY NAMES drift across the fleet and are not trustworthy - confirmed
# 2026-07-27: "Heartbeat Writer" (travelbeast, ImageBeast), "HeartbeatWriter"
# (AmsterdamDesktop, no space), "Hearbeat Writer OneDrive" (ChatWorkHorse, typo'd
# "Hearbeat" + OneDrive suffix left over from the old transport), "Heartbeat Write
# OneDrive" (Surface3GC, typo'd "Write" not "Writer"). Task names are discovered
# by ACTION (the script path each task actually runs), same trick the fleet-configs
# snapshot scripts use, so display-name drift/typos never matter. Several boxes
# (travelbeast, ImageBeast, ChatWorkHorse, AmsterdamDesktop) launch via a generic
# "wscript.exe run_hidden*.vbs" wrapper whose OWN action never mentions the real
# script - only the .vbs file's contents do - so discovery reads the .vbs too when
# an action points at one, not just the task's Execute/Arguments fields.
#
# Run on a recurring Task Scheduler trigger (e.g. every 5 min). Safe to run
# even when everything is healthy - does nothing in that case.
#
# ASCII only - PowerShell 5.1 has no BOM handling and mis-decodes non-ASCII.
